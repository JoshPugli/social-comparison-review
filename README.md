# React + Django Application

This project is a full-stack application with a React frontend and a Django backend.

## Getting Started with the React Frontend

Before you start, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. This will include `npm`, which is necessary to install the dependencies and run the React application.

### Installing Dependencies

Navigate to the `frontend` directory where the `package.json` file is located and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### Running the Development Server
After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server by running:
```bash
npm start
```
Now you're ready to work on the frontend!

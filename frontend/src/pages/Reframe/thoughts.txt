Thinking Trap Challenge Reframe: This reframe directly addresses each of the inputted cognitive distortions

Direct Challenge Reframe: This reframe directly addresses and questions the distortion in a more general manner. 
It encourages the user to see the situation from a more realistic and objective perspective. 
For example, if the user's distorted thought is "I always fail when I try new things," the reframe could be, 
"Everyone has successes and failures. Can you think of times when you've succeeded or learned something valuable, 
even if it didnâ€™t go perfectly?"

Self-Compassion Reframe: Promote kindness and understanding towards oneself, countering negative self-judgments. 
For example, "What would you say to a friend in this situation? Can you offer the same kindness to yourself?"

Contextual Reframe: This type places the thought or situation in a broader context, helping to reduce its perceived impact or severity. 
For example, "While this situation is challenging, how significant will it be in a month or a year from now? 
Can broader context change how you feel about it?"
Directly Challenges the Distortion: This type directly challenges the thought or belief, 
often by presenting evidence or alternative perspectives.
